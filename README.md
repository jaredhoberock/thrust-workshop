Thrust Workshop
===============

Building __parallel programs__ is easy with [Thrust's](http://thrust.github.com) __power tools__ like parallel __maps__, __sorts__, and __reductions__.

This repository contains two exercises:

- **fun_with_points** is a beginner-level exercise, in which you will create a set of points on a 2D plane and classify
them into quadrants
- **more_points** is an intermediate/advanced exercse building upon *fun_with_points* to generate a quadtree for points
in a 2D plane

If you're interested in learning more about Thrust, check out the [quick start guide](https://github.com/thrust/thrust/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide) or browse the [extensive collection of example programs](https://github.com/thrust/thrust/tree/master/examples) to discover the parallelism hidden in everyday computations.
